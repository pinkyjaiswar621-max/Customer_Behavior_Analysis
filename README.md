# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
## Project Objective 
This project showcases the complete data analytics lifecycle, starting from loading and exploring raw data using Python to cleaning and preprocessing it for better data quality. The cleaned data is then stored and managed in SQL databases, where analytical queries are performed to extract meaningful business insights. The project also focuses on building interactive and easy-to-understand dashboards using Power BI and presenting the findings through clear reports and professional presentations created with Gamma, reflecting real-world analytics practices.
